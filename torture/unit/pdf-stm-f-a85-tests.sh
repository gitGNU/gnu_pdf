# This first part of this shell script takes a series of test inputs and  
# runs these inputs through the pdf-filter utility through the ASCII85 
# encoder and decoder.  These test inputs are pushed through the filters
# with varying cache sizes to further stress test the filter implementations.
#
# The second portion of this shell script pushes all the files from
# /torture/testdata/ through the encoder and then decoder and verifies
# that the end-result file matches the starting file by using md5sum.
# This is a convenient method of pushing large binary files through the
# filter and automatically testing the results - just copy the test files
# into the /torture/testdata/ directory and execute this script.
#
# This shell script was inspired by a simple test that jemarch executed
# using pdf-filter.  It went like this:
#
#$ echo -ne "one\ntwo\nthree" | ./utils/pdf-filter --cache=1 --a85enc --a85dec
#
# 

FILTER_EXEC=../../utils/pdf-filter

# Define the test data as A85_TD_x where x is a digit having no leading zeroes.
# Be certain to update the inner for-loop below to reflect the number of input
# data items defined.
