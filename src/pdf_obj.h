/* This library module implement the basic objects that compound a PDF
   document:

      - Null object (PDF_NULL_OBJECT)
      - Boolean value (pdf_boolean_t)
      - Integer number (pdf_integer_t)
      - Real number (pdf_real_t)
      - String (pdf_string_t)
      - Name (pdf_name_t)
      - Array (pdf_array_t)
      - Dictionary (pdf_dict_t)

   A generic data type capable to contain any type of PDF object is
   also included (pdf_obj_t). */
