/* This library module implement stream objects capable to front-end
   to several backends: filesystem files, memory buffers, sockets,
   etc.

   Filters (such as the PDF standard ones) are supported for both
   reading and writing. Many filters should be used in a single stream
   (are applied in the an order when writing and in the inverse order
   when reading).

/* Backends

   Each backend should provide the virtual functions depicted in the
   `pdf_stm_be_s' structure:

   `init'

       This call should initialize the internal state of the backend.

   `write_p'
   `read_p'
   `seek_p'
   `size_p'
   `peek_p'
   `close_p'
   `tell_p'
   
       Those boolean functions tell the stream frontend if the backend
       accepts reading, writing, seeking, peeking, closing or getting
       its size.

   `size'

       Return the size (in octects) of the storage managed by the
       backend. This function should only be called when `size_p'
       returns true.

   `seek'

       Seek in the backend storage. This function should only be
       called when `size_p' returns true.

   `tell'

       Return the current position of the read/write pointer in the
       backend storage. This function should only be called when
       `tell_p' returns true.

   `eof'

       Return PDF_TRUE if the read pointer is beyond the end of the backend storage.
 
   `read'

       Read data from the backend storage. This function should only
       be called when `read_p' returns true.

   `write'

       Write data to the backend storage. This function should only be
       called when `write_p' returns true.
  
   `flush'

       Flush the output buffer of the stream. This call may be ignored
       by some backends. The function return the number of bytes
       actually flushed (a zero value may not be an error if the
       storage backend doesnt implement flushing).

       This function should only be called when `write_p' returns
       true.
 
   `read_char'

       Read a character from the backend storage and return it in an
       integer (may be EOF). This function should only be called when
       `read_p' returns true.

   `peek_char'

       Peek a character from the backend storage and return it in an
       integer (may be EOF). This function should only be called when
       `peek_p' returns true.

   `close'

       Closes the backend storage. This function should only be called
       when `close_p' returns true.

/* Filters

   This stream implementation support the concept of read/write
   filters.

   Each filter should provide the virtual functions depicted in the
   `pdf_stm_filter_s' structure:

   `init'

       This call should initialize the internal state of the filter.

   `apply'

       This function apply an input buffer and writes the result of
       the application of the filter into an output buffer.

       If the contents of the input buffer doesnt conform valid data
       for the given buffer, this call should return PDF_FALSE.

   `dealloc'
  
       This function should dealloc all memory resources managed by the
       filter, and perform any needed finalization tasks.
