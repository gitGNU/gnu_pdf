 * NONE - Initial state; not reading a token.
 * COMMENT - Reading a comment.  buffer collects the comment bytes, excluding

 *   and 0 otherwise.
 * KEYWORD - Reading some regular characters into buffer; this could result
 *           in a symbol like "null", or a number.
 * NAME - Reading a name (which starts with '/').
 *   Substates:
 *     0 - normal state
 *     1 - just read a '#' (escape prefix)
 *     2 - read the first hex digit after '#'; the value is in charparam
 *   buffer collects the name, excluding the initial '/'.
 * STRING - Reading a literal string (enclosed in '(', ')').
 *   Substates:
 *     0 - normal state
 *     1 - ignore the next byte if its value is 10 (ASCII LF;
 *         this is used to treat CRLF as a single line ending)
 *     2 - just saw a backslash (escape prefix)
 *     3 - read 1 octal digit; the value is in charparam
 *     4 - read 2 octal digits; the value is in charparam
 *   intparam is the bracket nesting level; ')' at level 0 ends the string.
 *   buffer collects the string.
 * HEXSTRING - Reading a hex string.
 *   Substates:
 *     0 - initial state: we just saw the opening '<', and if the next byte is
 *         also '<' this is the start of a dictionary rather than a string
 *     1 - normal state (the next hex digit will be the first in a pair)
 *     2 - read the first hex digit; its value is in charparam
 *     3 - end state; saw the closing '>'
 *   buffer collects the string.
 * DICTEND - Just got a '>'; expecting another.
 *   Substates:
 *     0 - starting state
 *     1 - saw the second '>'
 * PENDING - Need to emit a token (determined by charparam) ASAP.
 * EOF - Can't continue tokenising (reached EOF, or beginning of stream)
