Autotools
---------
This distribution uses whatever versions of Automake, Autoconf, and
Gettext are listed in NEWS; usually the latest ones released.  If you
are getting the sources from bzr (or change configure.ac), you'll need
to have these tools installed to (re)build.  You'll also need help2man.
All of these programs are available from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu.

Dependencies
------------
There are some third party dependencies needed to build some of the
utilities shipped in this distribution.  The configure script checks
for the needed packages and drives the conditional compilation of the
impacted utitilities.  The dependencies are:
- mdb2rec depends on glib 2.0 and libmdb, available at
  http://mdbtools.sf.net.
- The encryption support depends on libgcrypt, available at
  http://www.gnu.org/s/libgcrypt.

Building
--------
After getting the bzr sources, and installing the tools above, you can run
  sh ./autogen.sh
to do a fresh build.  After that first time, running make should suffice.
